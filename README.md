# Convolutional Neural Network-Powered Food Recognition

• Data Preprocessing: Applying normalization, resizing, and format conversions to prepare fruit and vegetable images for model training and improve consistency across the dataset.

• Model Optimization: Comparing custom CNN architectures and various pretrained models (e.g., EfficientNet, ResNet, MobileNet) by tuning layers, neurons, epochs, and fine-tuning strategies to identify the best setup.

• Best Model Performance: Achieving high test accuracy by selecting the best-performing model, with strong visual alignment between predicted labels and actual food images.
